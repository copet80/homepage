          <h2>Space Rockin'</h2>
          <p>
            I originally composed this song for the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SpaceHeroes" target="_blank"
              >Space Heroes Universe</a
            >
            co-op band game. The song contains four tracks: Lead Guitar, Chord
            Guitar, Bass Guitar, and Drum. Each of this track is playable by a
            player to make up a band.
          </p>
          <p>
            Years after the virtual world was officially shut down, I remastered
            the song to breathe a new life into it. Although the song still
            remains structurally close to the original, the arrangement sounds
            richer thanks to Logic Pro default reverbs and instruments, as well
            as Alex Pfeffer's Titan guitar samples.

            The song contains some 54 tracks with equal arrangement complexity
            for strings, brass, woodwinds, and percussions.

          <h2>Marching Rabbits</h2>
          <p>
            This song is a composed by an 8 year old kid, originally titled
            "Hopping Bunny". As soon as he played it on the piano for me to
            listen to, I instantly fell in love. I loved its overall structure
            and cheerfulness. With his (and his parents') blessing, I extended
            his original composition and rearranged it to add more story
            elements and playful elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people likened the cheerfulness of this song to early Disney
            songs, perhaps due to the use of some tremolos and trills that were
            commonplace in cartoon movies. Thanks to the quality of EastWest
            Symphony Orchestra instruments. The song contains some 48 tracks
            with more focus on woodwinds than the strings and brass sections.

            I composed this song (and lyrics) for my wife, for no specific
            reason. I just felt like it to be honest. Thanks to a group of
            friends who helped me get the bass line, key change, and lyrics more
            interesting and natural.

            There was a lot, and I mean a lot, of people wondering who the
            vocalist was. Well, it's a bit complicated. I didn't hire a vocalist
            to sing it. I did use an amazing software called Synthesizer V with
            a very beautiful voice bank by the Japanese vocalist, Kohaku Rikka.

            Michiko Naruke is a brilliant Japanese composer and she composed one
            of the most beautiful game theme sountrack ever composed, a
            masterpiece, titled "Into the Wilderness" for a Playstation RPG game
            title "Wild Arms".

            This arrangement was my first attempt at using Logic Pro to create
            music as a step-up from MIDI-ish songs. Thanks to Realitone's
            Realiswhistle, I was able to get the whistle sounding more humanlike
            than I initially anticipated.
